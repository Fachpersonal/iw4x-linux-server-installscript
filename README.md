Forked from linkuso's installscript

Currently under development and not usable since there are some bugs with debian 10

# iw4x-linux-server-installscript
Script to install IW4x + IW4M-Admin and wine on a Debian 10 Linux server
New and updated download Links 2021

Make the install.sh executable as root by running " chmod +x install.sh "

Run install.sh as root and follow the prompts.

If you specify a username that doesn't exist, this will create a new user account to run the iw4x server - you will need to specify the username and password, be sure to remember them!
